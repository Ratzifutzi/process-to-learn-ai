# My process to learn AI
Here I want to share my progress that I do with learning how to code and understand AI's

**Disclaimer:** Every code is written and tested in [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com/). Every file contains a Link where you can just open the code in [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com/). I use [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com/) since all the required libaries are already pre-installed and you don't need to have a powerfull PC to run the code since Google gives enough performance to use. No download required and no registration.
